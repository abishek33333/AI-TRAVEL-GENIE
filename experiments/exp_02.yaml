# this file tell s us What is the safest and most effective temperature for an AI Trip Planner?

name: temperature_sweep
description: Parameter sweep across different temperature values to measure creativity vs. factual accuracy trade-off
# This experiment does not change agents or tools.
# It changes only one LLM parameter: temperature.

model:
  provider: groq

  max_tokens: 8000

parameter_sweep:
  variable: temperature
  values: [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]
  # Instead of running one experiment, you run many, changing only

  configurations:
    - id: temp_0.0
      temperature: 0.0   #Model always picks the highest-probability token
      hypothesis: "Maximally deterministic, lowest hallucination risk"
      # Output is:very rigid repetitive extremely factual

    
    - id: temp_0.1
      temperature: 0.1
      hypothesis: "Balanced determinism with slight flexibility (baseline)"
    
    - id: temp_0.3
      temperature: 0.3
      hypothesis: "Moderate creativity, may introduce stylistic variation"
      # Risk:Slightly incorrect opening hours ,Soft assumptions about activities
    
    - id: temp_0.5
      temperature: 0.5
      hypothesis: "Higher creativity, risk of fabricated details"

evaluation_metrics:
  primary:
    - factual_accuracy  # % of verifiable place names
    - hallucination_rate  # Count of fabricated details
  
  secondary:
    - response_variety  # Lexical diversity across runs
    - tool_call_consistency  # Variance in tool sequences

expected_findings:
  - "Temperature 0.0-0.1: Highest factual accuracy, low variety"
  - "Temperature 0.3-0.5: Increased creativity, higher hallucination risk"
  - "Optimal temperature for travel planning: 0.1-0.2"
